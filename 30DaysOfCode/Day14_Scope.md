# Day 14: Scope
## Objective

Today we're discussing scope. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

The absolute difference between two integers, **a** and **b**, is written as **|a - b|**. The maximum absolute difference between two integers in a set of positive integers, **elements**, is the largest absolute difference between any two integers in **elements**.

The Difference class is started for you in the editor. It has a private integer array (**elements**) for storing **N** non-negative integers, and a public integer (**maximumDifference**) for storing the maximum absolute difference.


## Task

Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

- A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the **elements** instance variable.
- A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any **2** numbers in **N** and stores it in the **maximumDifference** instance variable.


## Input Format

You are not responsible for reading any input from stdin. The locked Solution class in your editor reads in **2** lines of input; the first line contains **N**, and the second line describes the **elements** array.


## Constraints
   
- **1 <= N <= 10**
- **1 <= elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N - 1**

## Output Format

You are not responsible for printing any output; the Solution class will print the value of the **maximumDifference** instance variable.


## Sample Input

```
3
1 2 5
```


## Sample Output

```
4
```

## Explanation
   
The scope of the **elements** array and **maximumDifference** integer is the entire class instance. The class constructor saves the argument passed to the constructor as the **elements** instance variable (where the computeDifference method can access it).

To find the maximum difference, computeDifference checks each element in the array and finds the maximum difference between any **2** elements: **|1 - 2| = 1**

**|1 - 5| = 4**
**|2 - 5| = 3**

The maximum of these differences is **4**, so it saves the value **4** as the **maximumDifference** instance variable. The locked stub code in the editor then prints the value stored as **maximumDifference**, which is **4**.

## Solution 
### C++

```
// Add your code here
    Difference(vector<int> a){
        elements = a;
        maximumDifference=0;
    }
    void computeDifference(){
        int n= elements.size()-1;
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            for(int j=1; j<n; j++){
                if(maximumDifference < abs(elements[i]-elements[j+1])){
                    maximumDifference = abs(elements[i]-elements[j+1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}; // End of Difference class
  
```
